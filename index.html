                  <p>
                    <p class="t">Character, possibilities : </p>These people are successful at what they do thanks to their perseverance and systematic work. Consistency and order are very important to them. They will achieve success later in life by working hard. Patience is important. These people are practical and conservative. They do not like changes but they do not like monotonous life either. They are usually physically strong, so they prefer activities where they can use their physical strength and dexterity. They are hardworking. They need to be sure of their partnerÂ´s loyalty.</p>
                  <p class="x">
                    Weaknesses, what should be learned: Beware of carelessness and a narrow view of life. These people should be careful when they are making decisions. What they experience should not be turned inward because it will affect the nervous system; it is therefore important to release cumulated energy. These people might lack confidence.

                    <p class="t">Sun in Pisces <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-ryby.gif"/></p>People born under the sign of Pisces are just like people born under the sign of Aquarius influenced by two planets. Jupiter gives them sense for justice, social conscience and willingness to help others, while Neptune both helps them and complicates their life. Neptune gives them imagination, creativity and emotionality, but it also gives them hypersensitivity and dreaminess that leads to passivity, indecision and excessive sensitivity
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <p class="z">Sun in the 8th house</p>The Sun in the eighth house gives people profound creativity and a broader understanding of life. The Sun gives these people perceptiveness and sensitivity for the values of others. It usually means that these people will have some responsibilities in this area. They understand social values and their views correspond with this understanding. Their activities focus on the assets and resources of other people and their energy will be used on a joint venture. They may do well in financial institutions or in sociological research, for example. Either way, they are creative and inquisitive.

                    <p class="t">Moon in Scorpio <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-stir.gif"/></p>Moon in Scorpio creates the need to delve into your feelings as deep as possible and this brings great vulnerability. You never forget anything that was done to you. It's hard to force you to do anything.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <p class="z">Moon in the 4th house</p>The Moon in the fourth house means a strong connection with home - not only the house where people live, but also with home in a broader sense - with their country, traditions, nature etc. These people usually have the need to feel a connection with the past and they are interested in things like antiques or their family tree. They often remain under the strong influence of their parents. The Moon in the fourth house indicates that they want to distance themselves from the reality and they have subjectivist inclinations. These people may be insecure. Their nature needs stable and reliable roots.

                      <p class="t">Mercury in Pisces <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-ryby.gif"/></p>People with Mercury in Pisces like art, mysticism and psychology. These people speak with emotions. They have a sensitive mind that absorbs a lot of information. Ideas and solutions emerge easily, without any effort. Because of this mental connection, they are sometimes not sure if their thoughts are their own. They unfortunately often resist the sensitivity of their mind. They doubt their credibility because it seems to them that some thoughts and opinions come "from elsewhere." Resisting the sensitivity of their brain will eventually lead to certain mental exhaustion. However, if they stop worrying about it and let their ideas flow through their mind then these thoughts will give them great inspiration.

                      <p class="z">Mercury in the 8th House</p><p>Mercury in the eighth house represents the house of sharing resources. These people are great researchers and they like to find out how things work. They like to think about life. They are often interested in financial matters - insurance policies or financial resources that belong to other people. Their interest in human behaviour and human reactions are the reason why they often study related fields.

                      <p class="t">Venus in Aquarius <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-vodnar.gif"/></p>People with Venus in Aquarius have an open and experimental approach to relationships and art. On the one hand, it can be both relaxing and stimulating because it lets other people relax and be themselves. But on the other hand it may be harder to understand their feelings because their style may be disturbing, shocking or weird. They want to satisfy all types of people with their liberal attitude but if they do not adhere to some moral code, their relationships will end when their partner finds out that their broad-mindedness and free spirit are only manifestations of hidden objections. Their cold and impersonal personality may be ok on social events or with their friends, but it may be the reason why somebody who is more than a friend leaves them.

                      <p class="z">Venus in the 8th house</p><p>Venus in the sixth House points to social activities, love affairs or romantic relationships in the workplace. It can also mean an emotional bond to work. In any case it means a comfortable and pleasant working environment. These people often work as judges or referees, or in jobs that deal with women. The influence of Venus in the sixth house brings artistic talent that could decide about the profession of these people.

                    <p class="t">Mars in Gemini <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-blizenci.gif"/></p>Mars in the Gemini never stops moving. These people have many projects and ideas, but their energy is fragmented because air signs are known for not wanting to put up a fight. Instead, when something does not work out, they redirect their energy on a new goal. Of course, aggressive Mars does not like this very much. Fortunately, their activity is joined with intelligence. Their fiery temperament manifests itself mainly verbally, abruptly and swiftly. If people with Mars in Gemini want to get something or know something, they ask. It may happen that they will impulsively gain something or someone, but they will not know what to do with it or with the person. So it will not take long before their tireless mind and moving body starts looking for something else, they will get it and they will not know what to do with it again. And this will happen again and again.

                    <p class="z">Mars in the 10th House</p><p>Mars in the tenth house suggests people who want to improve their social status. Their energy is focused on career and they want to be successful. Mars in this position usually means interest in politics or the army. These people are often managers. They show initiative and they have the ability to achieve their goals. It is a powerful position that does not suggests a participatory attitude towards others unless it is mentioned in another part of the horoscope. Regardless of the influences of the other parts of the horoscope, they are usually people with leadership skills.

                    <p class="t">Jupiter in Scorpio <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-stir.gif"/></p>People with Jupiter in Scorpio have a life philosophy of "no profit without hardship" which leads to a powerful desire for depth, darkness, and mystery. They dislike superficial happiness and their precious feelings are hidden in their dark side. They are willing to go through difficult situations to access these feelings and may find opportunities for sexual experiences during their search for depth and catharsis.

                    <p class="z">Jupiter in the 4th House</p>
                    Jupiter in the fourth house means that this planet of development and expansion will play an important role in the home and family of these people who will be under the influence of their parents until they are quite old. Parents, especially mothers, take good care of them, help them and give them good manners and education. This will result in high quality education and advantages in their social life. The life of these people will be full and happy, especially in later life.</p>
